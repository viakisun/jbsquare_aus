# JB SQUARE - Bio-Innovation Hub

This project is a comprehensive, high-fidelity, and responsive landing page for "JB SQUARE," a fictional bio-innovation hub. It has been significantly expanded from a single component into a full-fledged, runnable web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

The page features a rich, multi-section layout with detailed mock data, dropdown navigation, and a polished, modern design aesthetic.

-   **Expanded Content:** All sections now feature a larger, more realistic set of mock data.
-   **New Sections:** Includes newly added sections for Support Ecosystem, Policy & Investment, and Research & Patents.
-   **Enhanced Footer:** The footer is now more functional with a newsletter form and social media links.
